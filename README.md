# Task Manager Frontend

## Short Description

This is the frontend of the Task Manager application, built using React. It connects to the backend via RESTful APIs and Socket.IO for real-time updates. The app allows users to manage tasks across different categories (To-Do, In Progress, Done), authenticate using Firebase, and see updates in real-time.
